## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

First things first: HUNGRIMIND HUNGRIMIND HUNGRIMIND!

This is the home of all the code produced by the Hungrimind team ([Tadas](https://x.com/tadaspetra) and [Robert](https://x.com/RobertBrunhage)).

Our dream is to help you build stuff. We are trying to build a sustainable business (Hungrimind) so we can do this full-time. However, providing open-source resources is also at the core of our values.

Most of the code we write is open for you to explore. Some of it is used within our course: [The Best Flutter Course on the Internet](https://www.hungrimind.com/learn/flutter).

But there are also open source projects we work on:
- [Flutter of the Year](https://github.com/hungrimind/flutter-of-the-year) - The largest collection of indie-built Flutter apps.
- [Sync Test](https://github.com/hungrimind/sync_test) - A command line tool to sync your test files to your `lib` files.

Feel free to contribute to any repo and leave an issue on any of the repos!

To support us, you can purchase [The Best Flutter Course on the Internet](https://www.hungrimind.com/learn/flutter) or [sponsor us on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/hungrimind).
